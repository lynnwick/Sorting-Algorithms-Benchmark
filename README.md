# Sorting Algorithms Benchmark

Project for the Module "Computational Thinking with Algorithms" of the H.Dip in Computer Science in Software Development - GMIT

# Overview

For the project, write an application which will be used to Benchmark 5 Sorting Algorithms. 
The chosen algorithms benchmarked: Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort.

Each Sorting Algorithm is benchmarked using arrays of randomly generated integers of different sizes. The running time of each Algorithm 
is calculated by the average of the running time of each Algorithm and each input size measured 
10 times (new array of random integers for each run).

Sizes integers tested: 100,    250,    500,   1000,   1250,  2500,   3750,   5000,  6250,   7500,   8750,  10000.
